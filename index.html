										<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My interest in IT is video game, as it has been a thing that I always fond of eversince I was a child. I grew up and got to enjoy many different types of game and with it, spark my imagination and also, my hope that one day I can work in developing a game myself.</br>
									And for my reason to choice RMIT is it because I know that many have succceded in finding a job that they love to do after graduation and RMIT also have alots of well respected and knowladgeable professors that are willingly in helping their students achive it.</br>
									I expect to be able to learn not only relevant skill for my choice of field of work, but also crucial life experience, as well as beneficial skill that I can use outside that can help me out of problemnatic situation. For an example, creating a website.

									<h2>My Idea Job</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Job link:https://www.indeed.com/q-Game-Designer-jobs.html?vjk=5eb5b152d97e9d8d</br><img src="images/job.png" alt="job" height"20" width"30" /></br>
									What appeals to me is that in this position, is that it allow creativity,as well as the ability to add in your thought into reality, making it accessible to large group of audience, who can always give you thought out critism and improve you to do better. It also allow you to work with other who share the same passion as you do, making good agreement and disagreement about how you want it to go will make this carree an exciting one to have.</br>
                                    The job required 2 years of experience with at least one shippedpped title, the ability to co-operate with others, as well as the ability to make storries and love for the job.</br>
                                    What I have now is no where near, as I'm a first year, with no shipped tile, but at least I can said that I can work with others who are willingly and show that they are determined to finish the job with full concentration.</br>
                                    I hope that during tmy time at RMIT, I can finish a solo project to see how far my own abilities is at, and see whether or not I can keep my imaginative mind for long period of time and use it to it full potential.									</p>

									<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I have done 3 tests:the personality test, the learning test, and the creativity test.</p>
									<div class="features">
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/1st.png" alt="fisrt1" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>The results of the Myers-Briggs test.</h4>
												<p>according to the test, my personality is that of a mediator duo to the fact that I'm quite an introvert,as well as being a heavy turbulent person.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/learn.png" alt="learning"  /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>The results of the online learning style test</h4>
												<p>it's suggested that I'm best studying visualy and not really impressive at learning in an auditory and kinesthetic way. </p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/create.png" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>The results of the creativity test</h4>
												<p>The chart said that my creativity is only silghtly higher than most people average, and my persistence is abstractly lower</br>
												</br>
												After finishing the tests, I have to admited that all 3 are mostly correct in describing me. This however, doesn't really show me much as I, for once, know what kind of person I'm. I know that I takes it better learning in a kinesthetic way compare to visualy. And most important, is the fact that I'm way more worse compare to how these 3 tests descirbe me.</br>
												If I take the results from these tests and see how would it affect/influence how well I work with my team, it would become apperant that I will have a hard time to co-operate with my teamates, as well as being an assest that will not be great of help thanks to my ability in not being able to share beacuse of my shyness to other.</br>
												I belive that for me, the best solution is to bulit a team with people that I know relatively well,especially people who can share their thought without being shy, and pressure me until I give a respone to the question at hand. </p>

										<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									</header>
									<p>For my project, what I would like to do, is to make a game, similar to those old JRPG where you have a main protagonist, who would go on and do something significant, but the part that makes it part off from the way that most JRPG is that in my game, there are multiples ending, affected by a time system, plus the way you play the game(as well as random element to make each playthrough different).</br>
The reason why I want to do something like this is, firstly, my love for games, JRPG especially. I have font memory of these types of game, and it motivate me to want to make one on my own. Secondly, for most part, this type of game rarely ever have more than 1 different ending, and this make me think that if different endings are to be introduce, it will make the moment you finish, more meaningful and impactful, knowing that you have achieved the endings in which you want. Finally, the game that I want to make is something that I would like to use as a moral choices game, to see how, in different situation, would people do, for example, if there are currently a raid( which happen duo to your previous choices), and your best friend from childhood has been captured, while your love interest who recently agreed to your proposal it currently stuck in a mass of debris, cause by the raid, who will you rescue? And for me, finding out that is very interesting. </br>
This game will be like most old time JRPG, where characters would be mainly just be couple of pixels but, would have their own art illustrate in conversation/cutscene. It would have an open world hub that allow you to travel from destination to destination, and you are free to do what you seen as the appropriate choices for the time being. You will have a daytime cycle that affects your parties, monster, and mission which you can use the advantage of daytime to make harder or easier. You will have set of limited time to finish some quest which, depend on the quest demand, would have different reward when you do it in a specific amount of time. And if you paid attention to the quest details and do actions that are written in the quest recap but not on the objective box, you could potentially change the outcome of how the quest would end. Your choices also matter in dialogue option in many moments, which can be varies from little thing like small talk to your party members, to major plot points like dialogue between you and one of the bosses. So, because of how the game work, depends on your relationship with characters in game, you can potentially make a game on your own, completely derailed from the original narrative as you continue to process though the game. Combine this with difficult choices when it comes to moral dilemma, it will create all kind of different scenarios in which the game could leads you to. The game will have a total of 6 endings, which you must be able to achieved all six  before 1 extra ending will be unlock, as one the 6 endings carries a scenario that most can consider to be quite “special” and therefore,  have major impact to the plot itself, allowing player to have additional dialogue, as well as quest for the 7 and last ending.</br> 
In order to make this game, a lot of coding while be included, especially C# and uses of the unity engine as well. And with it, I believe that at my level and the time that I have, 20 to 30% of the project could be finish, which included the firsts section of the game, also known as the first chapter, as well as making sure that the game art/illustration which will also be done by myself as well. So, to summarize, I would need to learn how to use C#, as well as unity, and doing the art assets myself.</br>
If the project came out as an success and I was able to gain something out from it, I hope that it will mean a secure job as a game designer, maybe not immediately at my choices of studio, but a step into the world that I dream off ever since I was still small, and perhaps, satisfied my need for a dose of self confidence and urge to see people moral choices so I can understand better how people choices work.
